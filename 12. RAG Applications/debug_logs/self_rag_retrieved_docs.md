to generate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value.

## Income Taxes

We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the global intangible low tax Income provision as a current period expense.

We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.

## Business Combinations

We include  the  results  of  operations  of  the  businesses  that  we  acquire  as  of  the  acquisition  date.  We  allocate  the  purchase  price  of  the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized  in  accordance  with  our  revenue  recognition  policy.  The  excess  of  the  purchase  price  over  the  fair  values  of  identifiable  assets  and liabilities  is  recorded  as  goodwill.  Acquisition-related  expenses  are  recognized  separately  from  the  business  combination  and  are  expensed  as incurred.

## Foreign Currency

We translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders' equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&amp;E.

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2023, the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07 "Segment Reporting (Topic 280):Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024,  and  for  interim  periods  beginning  January  1,  2025,  with  early  adoption  permitted.  We  are  currently  evaluating  the  potential  effect  that  the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.

In  December  2023,  the  FASB  issued ASU  2023-09  "Income  Taxes  (Topics  740):  Improvements  to  Income  Tax  Disclosures"  to  expand  the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.

## Alphabet Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Nature of Operations

Google  was  incorporated  in  California  in  September  1998  and  re-incorporated  in  the  State  of  Delaware  in  August  2003.  In  2015,  we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. ("Alphabet") became the successor issuer to Google.

We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for consumer subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices.

## Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

## Use of Estimates

Preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; content licenses; contingent liabilities; fair values of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting  estimate  was  effective  beginning  in  fiscal  year  2023.  Based  on  the  carrying  value  of  servers  and  certain  network  equipment  as  of December 31, 2022, and those placed in service during the year ended December 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $3.9 billion and an increase in net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.24 per basic and $0.24 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.

## Revenue Recognition

Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues.

## Advertising Revenues

We generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:

- Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;
- YouTube properties; and
- Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.

Our customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google Display &amp; Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.

We offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.

For ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues,

The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):

|                                           | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
|                                           | 2022                      | 2023                      |
| Net cash provided by operating activities | $ 91,495                  | $ 101,746                 |
| Net cash used in investing activities     | $ (20,298)                | $ (27,063)                |
| Net cash used in financing activities     | $ (69,757)                | $ (72,093)                |

## Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Our largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search &amp; other properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash through consumer subscriptions and the sale of apps and in-app purchases  and  devices.  In  Google  Cloud  we  generate  cash  through  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure,  platform, collaboration tools, and other cloud services.

Our  primary  uses  of  cash  from  operating  activities  include  payments  to  distribution  and  Google  Network  partners,  to  employees  for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities include payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2022 to 2023 due to the increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses.

## Cash Used in Investing Activities

Cash provided by investing activities  consists  primarily  of  maturities  and  sales  of  investments  in  marketable  and  non-marketable  securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.

Net cash used in investing activities increased from 2022 to 2023 due to a decrease in maturities and sales of marketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in payments for acquisitions.

## Cash Used in Financing Activities

Cash  provided  by  financing  activities  consists  primarily  of  proceeds  from  issuance  of  debt  and  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  interests  in consolidated  entities.  Cash  used  in  financing  activities  consists  primarily  of  repurchases  of  stock,  net  payments  related  to  stock-based  award activities, and repayments of debt.

Net cash used in financing activities increased from 2022 to 2023 due to an increase in repurchases of stock.

## Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements

We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

## Capital Expenditures and Leases

We make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products.

## Capital Expenditures

Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:

- technical  infrastructure,  which  consists  of  our  investments  in  servers  and  network  equipment  for  computing,  storage,  and  networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to as our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and
- office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as "fit-outs").

Construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects  are  generally  multi-year  projects  with  multiple  phases,  where  we  acquire  land  and  buildings,  construct  buildings,  and  secure  and  install information technology assets.
