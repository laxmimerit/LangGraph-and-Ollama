(1) The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company's Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

(2) As of December 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, total marketable securities included $13.9 billion and $13.8 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the European Commission decision finding that Ireland granted state aid to the Company, and other agreements.

The following table shows the fair value of the Company's non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of December 30, 2023 (in millions):

| Due after 1 year through 5 years   | $ 72,994   |
|------------------------------------|------------|
| Due after 5 years through 10 years | 9,368      |
| Due after 10 years                 | 17,113     |
| Total fair value                   | $ 99,475   |

## Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not  to  hedge  certain  exposures  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  accounting  considerations  or  the  prohibitive  economic  cost  of  hedging  particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.

## Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 30, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 19 years.

The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange  rates,  as  well  as  to  offset  a  portion  of  the  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  generated  by  the  remeasurement  of  certain  assets  and  liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

## Apple Inc.

## Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

## Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively 'Apple' or the 'Company'). In the opinion of the Company's management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  ('GAAP')  requires  the  use  of  management  estimates.  Certain  prior  period  amounts  in  the  condensed consolidated  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current  period's  presentation.  These  condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 (the '2023 Form 10-K').

The Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company's fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

## Note 2 - Revenue

Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three months ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were as follows (in millions):

|                                 | Three Months Ended   | Three Months Ended   |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
|                                 | December 30, 2023    | December 31, 2022    |
| iPhone ®                        | $ 69,702             | $ 65,775             |
| Mac ®                           | 7,780                | 7,735                |
| iPad ®                          | 7,023                | 9,396                |
| Wearables, Home and Accessories | 11,953               | 13,482               |
| Services                        | 23,117               | 20,766               |
| Total net sales                 | $ 119,575            | $ 117,154            |

Total  net  sales  include  $3.5  billion  of  revenue  recognized  in  the  three  months  ended  December  30,  2023  that  was  included  in  deferred  revenue  as  of September  30,  2023  and  $3.4  billion  of  revenue  recognized  in  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2022  that  was  included  in  deferred  revenue  as  of September 24, 2022.

The  Company's  proportion  of  net  sales  by  disaggregated  revenue  source  was  generally  consistent  for  each  reportable  segment  in  Note  10,  'Segment Information and Geographic Data' for the three months ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.

As of December 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.5 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively. As of December 30, 2023, the Company expects 66% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 1% in greater than three years.

In January 2024, the Company announced changes to iOS, the App Store and Safari in the European Union to comply with the Digital Markets Act (the 'DMA'), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company's operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces ('APIs') for developers. Although the Company's compliance plan is intended to address the DMA's obligations, it is still subject to potential challenge by the European Commission or private litigants. In addition, other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the European Union are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks the DMA poses to European Union users, many risks will remain. ®

The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against  the  Company  that  could,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  have  a  materially  adverse  impact  on  the  Company's  business,  results  of  operations  and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.

Further,  the  Company  has  commercial  relationships  with  other  companies  in  the  technology  industry  that  are  or  may  become  subject  to  investigations  and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company's commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company's platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.

There  can  be  no  assurance  the  Company's  business  will  not  be  materially  adversely  affected,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  by  the  outcomes  of  such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company's business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company's products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.

(1) The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company's Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

(2) As of December 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, total marketable securities included $13.9 billion and $13.8 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the European Commission decision finding that Ireland granted state aid to the Company, and other agreements.

The following table shows the fair value of the Company's non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of December 30, 2023 (in millions):

| Due after 1 year through 5 years   | $ 72,994   |
|------------------------------------|------------|
| Due after 5 years through 10 years | 9,368      |
| Due after 10 years                 | 17,113     |
| Total fair value                   | $ 99,475   |

## Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not  to  hedge  certain  exposures  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  accounting  considerations  or  the  prohibitive  economic  cost  of  hedging  particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.

## Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 30, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 19 years.

The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange  rates,  as  well  as  to  offset  a  portion  of  the  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  generated  by  the  remeasurement  of  certain  assets  and  liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

## Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose  not  to  hedge  certain  exposures  for  a  variety  of  reasons  including  accounting  considerations  or  the  prohibitive  economic  cost  of  hedging  particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.

The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.

## Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

## Interest Rate Risk

To protect the Company's term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.

## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.

## Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements'). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the 'PCAOB'), Apple Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

## Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.'s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be  communicated to the  audit  committee  and  that:  (1)  relates  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

## Uncertain Tax Positions

As of September 30, 2023, the total amount                                                                                          |

|                             | in of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $19.5 billion, of which $9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.'s effective tax rate.

## Note 2 - Revenue

The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services  are  transferred  to  its  customers.  For  most  of  the  Company's  Products  net  sales,  control  transfers  when  products  are  shipped.  For  the  Company's Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.

The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company's expectations and historical experience.

For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices ('SSPs'). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company's best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations  would  be  if  they  were  sold  regularly  on  a  stand-alone  basis.  The  Company's  process  for  estimating  SSPs  without  observable  prices  considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.

The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud , Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with  each  device.  The  Company  allocates  revenue  and  any  related  discounts  to  these  performance  obligations  based  on  their  relative  SSPs.  Because  the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company's estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is  shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. ® ®

For  certain  long-term  service  arrangements,  the  Company  has  performance  obligations  for  services  it  has  not  yet  delivered.  For  these  arrangements,  the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.

For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product.  For  third-party  applications  sold  through  the App  Store,  the  Company  does  not  obtain  control  of  the  product  before  transferring  it  to  the  customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.
