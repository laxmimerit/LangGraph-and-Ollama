to generate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value.

## Income Taxes

We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the global intangible low tax Income provision as a current period expense.

We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.

## Business Combinations

We include  the  results  of  operations  of  the  businesses  that  we  acquire  as  of  the  acquisition  date.  We  allocate  the  purchase  price  of  the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized  in  accordance  with  our  revenue  recognition  policy.  The  excess  of  the  purchase  price  over  the  fair  values  of  identifiable  assets  and liabilities  is  recorded  as  goodwill.  Acquisition-related  expenses  are  recognized  separately  from  the  business  combination  and  are  expensed  as incurred.

## Foreign Currency

We translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders' equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&amp;E.

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2023, the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07 "Segment Reporting (Topic 280):Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024,  and  for  interim  periods  beginning  January  1,  2025,  with  early  adoption  permitted.  We  are  currently  evaluating  the  potential  effect  that  the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.

In  December  2023,  the  FASB  issued ASU  2023-09  "Income  Taxes  (Topics  740):  Improvements  to  Income  Tax  Disclosures"  to  expand  the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.

## Prior Period Reclassifications

Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.

## Alphabet Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Nature of Operations

Google  was  incorporated  in  California  in  September  1998  and  re-incorporated  in  the  State  of  Delaware  in  August  2003.  In  2015,  we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. ("Alphabet") became the successor issuer to Google.

We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for consumer subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices.

## Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

## Use of Estimates

Preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; content licenses; contingent liabilities; fair values of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting  estimate  was  effective  beginning  in  fiscal  year  2023.  Based  on  the  carrying  value  of  servers  and  certain  network  equipment  as  of December 31, 2022, and those placed in service during the year ended December 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $3.9 billion and an increase in net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.24 per basic and $0.24 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.

## Revenue Recognition

Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues.

## Advertising Revenues

We generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:

- Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;
- YouTube properties; and
- Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.

Our customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google Display &amp; Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.

We offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.

For ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues,

## Revenue Backlog

As of December 31, 2023, we had $74.1 billion of remaining performance obligations ('revenue backlog'), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue  backlog  and  timing  of  revenue  recognition  for  these  commitments  is  largely  driven  by  our  ability  to  deliver  in  accordance  with  relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.

## Deferred Revenues

We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $2.4 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023.
