(1) The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company's Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

(2) As of December 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, total marketable securities included $13.9 billion and $13.8 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the European Commission decision finding that Ireland granted state aid to the Company, and other agreements.

The following table shows the fair value of the Company's non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of December 30, 2023 (in millions):

| Due after 1 year through 5 years   | $ 72,994   |
|------------------------------------|------------|
| Due after 5 years through 10 years | 9,368      |
| Due after 10 years                 | 17,113     |
| Total fair value                   | $ 99,475   |

## Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not  to  hedge  certain  exposures  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  accounting  considerations  or  the  prohibitive  economic  cost  of  hedging  particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.

## Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 30, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 19 years.

The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange  rates,  as  well  as  to  offset  a  portion  of  the  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  generated  by  the  remeasurement  of  certain  assets  and  liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

## Apple Inc.

## Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

## Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively 'Apple' or the 'Company'). In the opinion of the Company's management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  ('GAAP')  requires  the  use  of  management  estimates.  Certain  prior  period  amounts  in  the  condensed consolidated  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current  period's  presentation.  These  condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 (the '2023 Form 10-K').

The Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company's fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

## Note 2 - Revenue

Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three months ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were as follows (in millions):

|                                 | Three Months Ended   | Three Months Ended   |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
|                                 | December 30, 2023    | December 31, 2022    |
| iPhone ®                        | $ 69,702             | $ 65,775             |
| Mac ®                           | 7,780                | 7,735                |
| iPad ®                          | 7,023                | 9,396                |
| Wearables, Home and Accessories | 11,953               | 13,482               |
| Services                        | 23,117               | 20,766               |
| Total net sales                 | $ 119,575            | $ 117,154            |

Total  net  sales  include  $3.5  billion  of  revenue  recognized  in  the  three  months  ended  December  30,  2023  that  was  included  in  deferred  revenue  as  of September  30,  2023  and  $3.4  billion  of  revenue  recognized  in  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2022  that  was  included  in  deferred  revenue  as  of September 24, 2022.

The  Company's  proportion  of  net  sales  by  disaggregated  revenue  source  was  generally  consistent  for  each  reportable  segment  in  Note  10,  'Segment Information and Geographic Data' for the three months ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.

As of December 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.5 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively. As of December 30, 2023, the Company expects 66% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 1% in greater than three years.

## Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-toyear comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.

## Fiscal Period

The Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company's fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each.

## Fiscal Year Highlights

The Company's total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023.

The Company's total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services.

The Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following:

First Quarter 2023:

- iPad and iPad Pro;
- Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and
- MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service.

## Second Quarter 2023:

- MacBook Pro 14', MacBook Pro 16' and Mac mini; and
- Second-generation HomePod.

Third Quarter 2023:

- MacBook Air 15', Mac Studio and Mac Pro;
- Apple Vision Pro™, the Company's first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS™, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and
- iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company's operating systems.

Fourth Quarter 2023:

- iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and
- Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2.

In May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion.

## Macroeconomic Conditions

Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.

## Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements'). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the 'PCAOB'), Apple Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

## Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.'s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be  communicated to the  audit  committee  and  that:  (1)  relates  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

## Uncertain Tax Positions

| Description of the Matter   | As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2023, the total amount                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                             | in of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $19.5 billion, of which $9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.'s effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws. |
|                             | Auditing management's evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.                                        |
