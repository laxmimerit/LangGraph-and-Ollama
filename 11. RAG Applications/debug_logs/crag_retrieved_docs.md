include payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase in tax payments and a cash payment for the 2017 EC shopping fine. The increase in tax payments in comparison to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to the 2023 IRS payment deferral relief made available to taxpayers headquartered in designated counties in California.

## Cash Used in Investing Activities

Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Cash  used  in  investing  activities  consists  primarily  of  purchases  of  marketable  and  non-marketable  securities,  purchases  of  property  and equipment, and payments for acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets.

Net cash used in investing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment and purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of marketable securities.

## Cash Used in Financing Activities

Cash  provided  by  financing  activities  consists  primarily  of  proceeds  from  issuance  of  debt  and  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  interests  in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, payment of dividends, and repayments of debt.

Net cash used in financing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to dividend payments and net payments related to stock-based award activities.

## Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements

We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient  to  fund  our  operating  activities  and  cash  commitments  for  investing  and  financing  activities  for  at  least  the  next  12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

## Capital Expenditures and Leases

We make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products.

## Capital Expenditures

Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:

- technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to as our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and
- office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as "fit-outs").

Construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction  projects  are  generally  multi-year  projects  with  multiple  phases,  where  we  acquire  land  and  buildings,  construct  buildings,  and secure and install information technology assets.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, we spent $21.2 billion and $38.3 billion on capital expenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2023  and  2024,  our  depreciation  on  property  and  equipment  was  $8.6  billion  and  $11.1  billion, respectively.

- office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as "fit-outs").

Assets not yet in service are those that are not ready for our intended use, including assets in the process of construction or assembly, and consists primarily of technical infrastructure. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install servers and network equipment.

During the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, we spent $25.2 billion and $39.6 billion on capital expenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2024, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when such assets are ready for our intended use. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, depreciation on property and equipment was $7.1 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively.

## Leases

As of June 30, 2025, the amount of total future lease payments under operating and finance leases was $17.4 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively.

As  of  June  30,  2025,  we  have  entered  into  leases  primarily  related  to  data  centers  that  have  not  yet  commenced  with  future  lease payments of $23.9 billion. These leases will commence between 2025 and 2031 with non-cancelable lease terms between one and 25 years.

For additional information on leases, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Financing

We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $25.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2025, we had $3.0 billion of short-term commercial paper outstanding.

In May 2025, we issued $5.0 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in four tranches: $750 million of 4.00% notes  due  2030,  $1.25  billion  of  4.50%  notes  due  2035,  $1.5  billion  of  5.25%  notes  due  2055,  and  $1.5  billion  of  5.30%  notes  due  2065. Additionally in May 2025, we issued €6.75 billion of euro-denominated fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in five tranches: €1.5 billion of 2.50% notes due 2029, €1.5 billion of 3.00% notes due 2033, €1.25 billion of 3.38% notes due 2037, €1.25 billion of 3.88% notes due 2045, and €1.25 billion of 4.00% notes due 2054. The net proceeds from all notes issued in May 2025 are used for general corporate purposes.

As of June 30, 2025, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $24.6 billion.

As of June 30, 2025, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2026 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2030. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates. No amounts have been borrowed under the credit facilities.

## Free Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing Obligations

Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by 'Principal repayments of finance leases' and 'Principal repayments of financing obligations.' Principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, 'Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,' for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 (in millions):

## Free Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments of All Other Finance Leases and Financing Obligations

Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in 'Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications,' principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in 'Principal repayments of finance leases,' and 'Principal repayments of financing obligations.' All other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, 'Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,' for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 (in millions):

## Interest Income and Expense

Our interest income was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion during Q2 2024 and Q2 2025, and $2.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, primarily due to a higher average balance of invested funds at prevailing rates. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediateterm marketable debt securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.

Interest expense was $589 million and $516 million during Q2 2024 and Q2 2025, and $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 3 - Leases and Note 5 - Debt' for additional information.

## Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net was $(18) million and $1.1 billion during Q2 2024 and Q2 2025, and $(2.7) billion and $3.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, foreign currency, and reclassification adjustments for gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt securities. The net gain of $1.1 billion in Q2 2025 is primarily from equity warrant valuations. The net loss of $(2.7) billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 is primarily from the marketable securities loss from our equity investment in Rivian. The net gain of $3.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2025 is primarily from the reclassification adjustment for the gain on available-for-sale debt securities from the portion of our convertible notes investments in Anthropic that were converted to nonvoting preferred stock during the three months ended March 31, 2025.

## Income Taxes

Our income tax provision for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $4.2 billion, which included $1.9 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our income tax provision for the six months ended June 30, 2025 was $7.2 billion, which included $753 million of net discrete tax benefits primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 7 - Income Taxes' for additional information.

## Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Free cash flow and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.

## Free Cash Flow

Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow. We provide a free cash flow measure because we believe it provides additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash. Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by 'Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.' The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, 'Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,' for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025 (in millions):

|                                                                                | Twelve Months Ended June 30,   | Twelve Months Ended June 30,   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
|                                                                                | 2024                           | 2025                           |
| Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities                            | $ 107,952                      | $ 121,137                      |
| Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives | (54,979)                       | (102,953)                      |
| Free cash flow                                                                 | $ 52,973                       | $ 18,184                       |
| Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities                            | $ (64,354)                     | $ (123,569)                    |
| Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities                            | $ (21,440)                     | $ (8,652)                      |

Free cash flow has limitations as it omits certain components of the overall cash flow statement and does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

## Note 3 - LEASES

We have entered into non-cancellable operating and finance leases for fulfillment network, data center, office, and physical store facilities as well as server and networking equipment, aircraft, and vehicles. Gross assets acquired under finance leases, including those where title transfers at the end of the lease, are recorded in 'Property and equipment, net' and were $62.5 billion and $59.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. Accumulated amortization associated with finance leases was $44.7 billion and $43.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.

Lease cost recognized in our consolidated statements of operations is summarized as follows (in millions):
