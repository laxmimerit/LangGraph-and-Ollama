(1) The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company's Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

(2) As of March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, total marketable securities included $14.0 billion and $13.8 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the European Commission decision finding that Ireland granted state aid to the Company, and other agreements.

The following table shows the fair value of the Company's non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of March 30, 2024 (in millions):

| Due after 1 year through 5 years   | $ 67,987   |
|------------------------------------|------------|
| Due after 5 years through 10 years | 9,108      |
| Due after 10 years                 | 18,092     |
| Total fair value                   | $ 95,187   |

## Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not  to  hedge  certain  exposures  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  accounting  considerations  or  the  prohibitive  economic  cost  of  hedging  particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.

## Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of March 30, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 18 years.

The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange  rates,  as  well  as  to  offset  a  portion  of  the  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  generated  by  the  remeasurement  of  certain  assets  and  liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

## Apple Inc.

## Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

## Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively 'Apple' or the 'Company'). In the opinion of the Company's management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ('GAAP') requires the use of management estimates. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 (the '2023 Form 10-K').

The Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company's fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

## Note 2 - Revenue

Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2024 and April 1, 2023 were as follows (in millions):

| Total net sales                 | $ 90,753             | $ 94,836             | $ 210,328          | $ 211,990          |

Total net sales include $3.3 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended March 30, 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of December 30, 2023, $3.5 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended April 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022, $5.1 billion of revenue recognized in the six months ended March 30, 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023, and $5.5 billion of revenue recognized in the six months ended April 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022.

The  Company's  proportion  of  net  sales  by  disaggregated  revenue  source  was  generally  consistent  for  each  reportable  segment  in  Note  10,  'Segment Information and Geographic Data' for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2024 and April 1, 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.

As of March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.6 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively. As of March 30, 2024, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26% within one-to-two years, 9% within two-to-three years and 1% in greater than three years.
