## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.

## Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements'). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the 'PCAOB'), Apple Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

## Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.'s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be  communicated to the  audit  committee  and  that:  (1)  relates  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

## Uncertain Tax Positions

| Description of the Matter   | As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2023, the total amount                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                             | in of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $19.5 billion, of which $9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.'s effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws. |
|                             | Auditing management's evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.                                        |

## Note 2 - Revenue

The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services  are  transferred  to  its  customers.  For  most  of  the  Company's  Products  net  sales,  control  transfers  when  products  are  shipped.  For  the  Company's Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.

The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company's expectations and historical experience.

For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices ('SSPs'). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company's best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations  would  be  if  they  were  sold  regularly  on  a  stand-alone  basis.  The  Company's  process  for  estimating  SSPs  without  observable  prices  considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.

The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud , Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with  each  device.  The  Company  allocates  revenue  and  any  related  discounts  to  these  performance  obligations  based  on  their  relative  SSPs.  Because  the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company's estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is  shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. ® ®

For  certain  long-term  service  arrangements,  the  Company  has  performance  obligations  for  services  it  has  not  yet  delivered.  For  these  arrangements,  the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.

For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product.  For  third-party  applications  sold  through  the App  Store,  the  Company  does  not  obtain  control  of  the  product  before  transferring  it  to  the  customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.
