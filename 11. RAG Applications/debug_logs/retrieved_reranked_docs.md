## Alphabet Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Nature of Operations

Google  was  incorporated  in  California  in  September  1998  and  re-incorporated  in  the  State  of  Delaware  in  August  2003.  In  2015,  we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. ("Alphabet") became the successor issuer to Google.

We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for consumer subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices.

## Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

## Use of Estimates

Preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; content licenses; contingent liabilities; fair values of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting  estimate  was  effective  beginning  in  fiscal  year  2023.  Based  on  the  carrying  value  of  servers  and  certain  network  equipment  as  of December 31, 2022, and those placed in service during the year ended December 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $3.9 billion and an increase in net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.24 per basic and $0.24 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.

## Revenue Recognition

Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues.

## Advertising Revenues

We generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:

- Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;
- YouTube properties; and
- Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.

Our customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google Display &amp; Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.

We offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.

For ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues,

TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.

## Operating Expenses

Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&amp;D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.

The main components of our R&amp;D expenses are:

- compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&amp;D related to our existing and new products and services;
- depreciation; and
- third-party  services  fees  primarily  relating  to  consulting  and  outsourced  services  in  support  of  our  engineering  and  product  development efforts.

The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:

- compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and
- spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.

The main components of our general and administrative expenses are:

- compensation  expenses  for  employees  in  finance,  human  resources,  information  technology,  legal,  and  other  administrative  support functions;
- expenses relating to legal matters, including certain fines and settlements; and
- third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services.

## Other Income (Expense), Net

OI&amp;E,  net  primarily  consists  of  interest  income  (expense),  the  effect  of  foreign  currency  exchange  gains  (losses),  net  gains  (losses)  and impairment  on  our  marketable  and  non-marketable  securities,  performance  fees,  and  income  (loss)  and  impairment  from  our  equity  method investments.

For additional information, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the value of our investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 as well as Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Provision for Income Taxes

Provision  for  income  taxes  represents  the  estimated  amount  of  federal,  state,  and  foreign  income  taxes  incurred  in  the  U.S.  and  the  many jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

For  additional  information,  including  a  reconciliation  of  the  U.S.  federal  statutory  rate  to  our  effective  tax  rate,  see  Note  14  of  the  Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Note 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas

We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:

- Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.
- Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates  revenues  primarily  from  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  received  for  Google  Cloud  Platform  services,  Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.
- Other  Bets  is  a  combination  of  multiple  operating  segments  that  are  not  individually  material.  Revenues  from  Other  Bets  are  generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.

Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.

Reflecting  DeepMind's  increasing  collaboration  with  Google  Services,  Google  Cloud,  and  Other  Bets,  beginning  in  the  first  quarter  of  2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet-level activities instead of within Other Bets. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation.

As announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind to significantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported within Alphabet-level activities prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the Brain team was included within Google Services.

Certain  costs  are  not  allocated  to  our  segments  because  they  represent Alphabet-level  activities.  These  costs  primarily  include AI-focused shared  R&amp;D activities,  including  development  costs  of  our  general AI  models;  corporate  initiatives  such  as  our  philanthropic  activities;  corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with reductions in our  workforce  and  office  space  during  2023  were  not  allocated  to  our  segments. Additionally,  hedging  gains  (losses)  related  to  revenue  are  not allocated to our segments.

Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.

The following table presents information about our segments (in millions):
